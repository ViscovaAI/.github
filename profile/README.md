## 🧠 About ViscovaAI

**ViscovaAI** is building the next generation of intelligent security infrastructure designed specifically for the modern era of **AI-assisted and vibe coding**.

As developers increasingly rely on AI to generate production code, traditional security tools fail to keep pace. ViscovaAI introduces a **multi-layer AI security engine** that continuously analyzes, validates, and protects applications across their entire lifecycle.

Our platform ensures that software created with AI is **secure by default**, not secure by accident.

## ⚡ Core Platform Capabilities

### 🔐 AI-Powered Code Security

* Real-time vulnerability detection
* Secret and API leak prevention
* Unsafe pattern identification
* AI-generated code hardening

### 🧩 Multi-Model Security Validation

ViscovaAI uses a **three-layer AI consensus engine**:

| Layer   | Engine   | Role                            |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Layer 1 | DeepSeek | Structural vulnerability scan   |
| Layer 2 | Kimi     | Validation & secure remediation |
| Layer 3 | Gemini   | Holistic security intelligence  |

This dramatically reduces false positives and increases trust.
